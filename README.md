Messing around, trying things.

First project (currently only project):
- Bank Account Simulator
- Can deposit, widthraw 'money'.
- Option to simulate investing and see how much return.
- Program also makes an API call to aexTrading to get live stock prices.
- Has 2D game where you can 'rob the bank', super fun. WARING: highly addictive, do not play at work.
- Currently working on saving purchased stocks to a JSON File that can parsed upon the next session to see gain/loss.
